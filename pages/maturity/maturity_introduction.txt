===== IT Practices Maturity Matrix =====

This ALM Maturity model is based on information from these locations:
  * The Pragmatic Capability Model Of Software Delivery (PCM-OSD) [(http://blog.figmentengine.com/2010/08/pragmatic-capability-model-of-software.html)]


==== Maturity Categories ====

  * Development: how we work with code
  * Building: how we turn code into deployable artefacts
  * Deploying: how we deploy into environments
  * Testing: how do we ensure that the deployment is good
  * Reporting: how we drive transparency (for quality)
  * Support: how we manage incidents and requests
  * Product Management: how we understand & communicate the product needs
  * Architecture: how we manage our technical direction
  * Operations: how we manage the run-time environments 


==== Maturity Models ====

GL = Guideline, VM = Virtual Machine, Repo = Repository
